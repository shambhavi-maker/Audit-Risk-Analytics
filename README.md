# Risk-Anlytics-
Risk management and  analytics using audit data leverages advanced data analytics to enhance risk assessment procedures, while wrapper methods like SFS provide a systematic approach to feature selection in predictive modeling.

Summary
=======
Exhaustive one year non-confidential data in the year 2015 to 2016 of firms is collected from the Auditor Office of India to build a predictor for classifying suspicious firms.The goal of the research is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).

Many risk factors are examined from various areas like past records of audit office, audit-paras, environmental conditions reports, firm reputation summary, on-going issues report, profit-value records, loss-value records, follow-up reports etc. After in-depth interview with the auditors, important risk factors are evaluated and their probability of existence is calculated from the present and past records.

The data are contained in the files audit_risk.csv, trial.csv.the cleaned data after computation is stored in sample.csv More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a development dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available benchmark datasets if that is your intent.

This and other data sets are publicly available for download at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/475/audit+data.
